    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with made from scratch tomato sauce and delicious, cheesy filling. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread, if desired.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>½ pound ground pork</li>
        <li>½ pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
    </ul>


    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add noodles and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain and set aside.</li>
        
        <li>Place pork and beef in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Stir in tomato sauce, crushed tomatoes, parsley, garlic, oregano, onion, sugar, basil and salt. Simmer over medium-low heat for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        
        <li>In a large bowl, combine cottage cheese, eggs, Parmesan cheese, parsley, salt and pepper.</li>
    </ol>

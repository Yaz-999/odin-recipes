    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Fresh tomatoes and a rich, cheesy filling make a summertime savory pie. There is a lot of preparation for this pie, but it is well worth every minute. I love this pie on summer mountain evenings. Enjoy with cool ice tea.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 recipe pastry for a 9-inch pie crust</li>
        <li>2 pounds heirloom tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 pound Roma tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 cup diced raw bacon</li>
        <li>Â½ cup sliced leek</li>
    </ul>
     
    <h3>Directions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Chill pie dough for about 1 hour.</li>
        
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place a baking sheet on the lower oven rack.</li>
        
       <li>Slice heirloom tomatoes into 1/2-inch rounds. Remove seeds with your fingers. Place 6 slices on paper towels or a clean cloth and cover with more paper towels or another clean cloth.
